# TwitterBot
Source code for TwitterBot - a bot that scrapes the web for current Canadian dollar exchange rates and tweets out the data.

# About
TwitterBot is all about providing citizens with a convenient way of accessing Canadian dollar exchange rates without having to manually search for the values. You may reach the bot's Twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/autobotproject) or by searching @AUTOBOTPROJECT on Twitter.

# How it was built
This bot was built using Selenium and programmed in Python. This bot scrapes data from https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exchange/daily-exchange-rates/ and then logs into a Twitter account I made specifically for this program and tweets the information.

Notice in the image above that one day's worth of statistics is broken up into three tweets. This is to work around the 280-character limit on individual tweets.
